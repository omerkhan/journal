## Currently

Building a personal journaling website to share moments with family and friends. Taking time to document the small things that make up a life.

## Reading

"The Creative Act: A Way of Being" by Rick Rubin – he is one of the most successful music producers of all time, despite having no traditional musical talent, because he does less, listens more, and trusts feeling and instinct over formulas.

## Learning

Getting more comfortable with photography. Trying to capture more every moments in Florida.

## Location

Home, enjoying the Florida winter. Appreciating the rhythm of shorter days and longer evenings.

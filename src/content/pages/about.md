This is a small corner of the internet where I share moments from my life. Think of it as a visual journal—a way to document the ordinary beauty that fills our days.

## Why this exists

Social media moves too fast. Posts disappear into algorithmic oblivion within hours. I wanted a slower, more intentional space to share with the people I care about.

Here, you'll find the morning light that caught my eye, the walk that cleared my head, the meal that brought everyone together. Nothing earth-shattering—just life, documented with care.

## Say hello

If something here resonates with you, I'd love to hear about it. You can reach me by email or find me in the usual places.

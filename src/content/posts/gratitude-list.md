Trying a new practice: writing down three good things from the day before bed.

Today's list:
1. The way the dog greeted me when I came home
2. A stranger held the door at the coffee shop
3. Found an old photo that made me laugh

None of these are remarkable. That's the point—remarkable happens in the ordinary if you're paying attention.

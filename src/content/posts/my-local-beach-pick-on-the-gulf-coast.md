As a tourist, I was drawn to the big-name beaches like Siesta Key. Now as a local, I prefer Coquina Beach. Plenty of free parking, room to spread out, and a more local feel.

It’s not perfect and does get busy on weekends, but  I'm lucky to have the freedom to be able to go on weekdays or arrive early on weekends, which makes all the difference.

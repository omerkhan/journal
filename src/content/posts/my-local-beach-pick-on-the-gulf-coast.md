As a tourist, I was drawn to the big-name beaches like Siesta Key. Now as a local, I much prefer Coquina Beach. Free parking, room to spread out, and a more local feel.

It’s not perfect and it does get busy on weekends, but I can go on weekdays or arrive early on weekends, which makes all the difference.

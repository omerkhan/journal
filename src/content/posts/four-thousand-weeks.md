Started Oliver Burkeman's "Four Thousand Weeks" last night. The premise hit hard: the average human lifespan is roughly 4,000 weeks. That's it.

Not as a reason for anxiety, but as permission to stop trying to "get on top of everything." You never will. The inbox will never be empty. The to-do list will never be done.

The question isn't how to fit everything in. It's what deserves the weeks you have.

I wasn’t excited about going to EPCOT. I much more preferred the idea of going back to the Magic Kingdom. But with this being the busiest week of the year at Disney World, EPCOT seemed like the least crowded option.

I’ve got to admit, though, I had a great day. There are some fun rides, and so much to explore (and eat) as you make your way through the different countries.

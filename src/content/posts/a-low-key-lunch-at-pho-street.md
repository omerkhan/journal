This place is in the middle of a car park behind a Rooms To Go store. It would be easy to miss if it wasn’t for the bright green exterior. 

Inside, it’s clean, calm, and quietly welcoming. The kind of place that’s perfect for a relaxed lunch, whether it’s pho, banh mi, or a simple rice or noodle dish. 

Nothing flashy, just comfortable food and an easy pace that makes you want to linger a little longer.

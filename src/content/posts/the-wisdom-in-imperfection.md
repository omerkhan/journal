The modern world tells us everything should be faster, cleaner, and perfectly put together. If something looks worn or unfinished, we assume it’s wrong  or broken.

Wabi Sabi says the opposite. It says the cracks matter. The rough edges matter. The signs of time and use are what make things feel real.

Not everything needs fixing or improving. Some things are already good because they’re little imperfect. Like all of us.

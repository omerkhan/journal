The modern world tells us everything should be faster, cleaner, and perfectly put together. If something looks imperfect, we assume there's something wrong with it.

Wabi Sabi has a different lens. It’s being okay with things that aren’t perfect. Things that are still in progress. Things that don’t need to be fixed or improved.

Not everything has to be optimized. Some things are fine just the way they are.
